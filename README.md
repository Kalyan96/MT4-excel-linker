### **Purpose**
The script interfaces between a MetaTrader 4 (MT4) trading platform log file and Excel, facilitating real-time data updates, alert generation, and technical indicator tracking. This assists me while doing real tiem day trading and also quickens my decision making and stock analysis with my custom indicators, which are not supported by trading platforms

### **Technical Highlights**

1. **File Stream Handling:**
   - Continuously monitors a `buffer.csv` file generated by MT4.
   - Efficiently manages file pointer positions (`seek()`) to process only new entries, ensuring minimal overhead.

2. **Excel Automation via `xlwings`:**
   - Dynamically reads and writes to multiple Excel sheets (`Sheet1`, `Sheet2`, `Sheet3`) with seamless real-time updates.
   - Implements search functions to match trading symbols and append relevant data to the appropriate rows.

3. **Symbol Search Logic:**
   - Uses `find_row()` to locate a specific symbol in `Sheet3` and ensures updates occur only for existing entries.
   - Logs unmatched symbols as errors, fostering robust error-handling capabilities.

4. **Data Processing:**
   - Parses incoming log data by splitting strings into structured components.
   - Writes technical indicator values (e.g., RSI, stochastic levels) and alerts to the Excel file.

5. **Automation Features:**
   - Real-time timestamp updates in `Sheet1`.
   - Handles dynamic row identification and updates with efficient row-based logic.
   - Logs and highlights updates for better traceability.
